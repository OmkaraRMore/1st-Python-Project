# Python code using If-Else statements

Hello my name is omkar,
I have shared a Python code which identifies the mail is correct or incorrect.


PROBLEM SOLUTION : 

I have considered email has atleast six or seven characters (ex. a@b.in or a@b.com),
and some other considerations are as below,
1) No space in between characters
2) Start index should not contain any special character ao any integer value
3) Any character should not be of Upper case
4) Email length should be greater <= 6
5) Should contain "@" and "." init

Thank You..
